These scripts work interactively to aggregate data for Threatened, Endangered, and Sensitive species 
for US Forest Service in Region 5. The scripts then complete a series of geoprocessing to produce
geodatabases as deliverables for the Washington Office. GDBs are also split by forest to be 
distributed for their respective forests to manage Aerial Fire Retardant Avoidance.

Hydrology scripts process and merge all of the NHD data distributed by the USGS to provide buffered
flowlines and waterbodies throughout the region.
